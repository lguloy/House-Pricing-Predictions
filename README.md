# House-Pricing-Predictions

Housing Price Predictions in Ames, IA
Team: Vijitha Samarasinghe, Lawrence Guloy, Clayton Grace

Purpose/Scope:

It is widely known that there are multiple variables that impact the price of a house. This project seeks to determine if other, non-standard variables influence the price of a house, and if so, by how much. The Ames Housing dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing many aspects of residential homes in Ames, IA. The purpose of this project is to analyze the Ames Housing dataset using machine learning in order to accurately predict the price of homes.

Methodology:

Random forest analysis will be used for the project since the dataset requires both classification and regression tasks. A SQL database will be hosted on an AWS virtual environment. Any visualizations of the data will be done using Tableau.

This project was derived from a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview
